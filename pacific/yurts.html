    <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
    <p>
        What is a yurt?<br>
        Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.<br>
        How are the yurts furnished?<br>
        Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. The luxury camping experience also includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.<br>
        What should I bring?<br>
        Bring a sense of adventure and some time to relax! Most guests also pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with layers of clothing.
